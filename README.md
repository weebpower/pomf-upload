# Usage
`$ pomf FILE`

By default, pomf.space is used to host the file. Please edit the urls in the beginning of the shell script if you want to use another domain. Don't forget to use HTTPS.

I got the original script from https://gist.github.com/KittyKatt/5818701. Thanks to KittyKatt and the commenters there!

All I did was some work on making it more portable, smaller, and more readable. Though I did add a dependency on jq.
